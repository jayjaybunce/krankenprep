## To Do List
- Fix login screen to be centered and not look poop (make the login card a bit poppy with some highlights and borders?)
- Abstract components into reusable parts
- Figure out roles? Guild creation, user management and roles
    - At a minimum just get it so admins can be created and used to get frontend stuff working
    - Implement a test admin toggle so you can easily swap between views and such stuff

- Get a layout working so that sidebar is fixed and the content moves
- Make sidebar expandable and not always out maybe?
